Priority 1

- Install.ps1:
  Build and install script

- Initialize-Amt or Test-Amt:
  Tests if everything is in place. Suggest install/build if something is wrong.

- Implement rest of the functionality / missing and throwing functions
  Get-AssignmentsForHit, Get-HitsForQualificationType, Get-QualificationsForQualificationType
  Get-ReviewableHits, Get-ReviewResultsForHIT, New-QuestionForm,
  Search-Hits, Send-TestEventNotification, Set-HitAsReviewing, Set-HitTypeNotification

- Review comment based help and adjust to PowerShell setting. Currently, help is just
  copy/paste from API documentation.

Priority 2

- Need some nice status report functions including nice headers:
  Get-AllHits | ft Title, HitStatus, NumberOfAssignmentsCompleted
  $hit | Get-AllAssignmentForHit | ft workerId, assignmentstatus, submittime

- Add templates for mturk.clt.properties, template.bonus.csv, template.codes.csv,
  ctl.imput, ctl.properties, ctl.question, and ctl.result files from the mturk repo.
  Add short explanation of what these files are, i.e. about_AmtTemplates.

- Pipelining
  Approve-Assignment, Grant-Bonus should take a lists and loop such that for-loops
  are not required.

- Get-BonusPayments: what is the maximal page size? Adjust help.

Priority 3

- Reproduce typical files like success file, etc.
- Split samples into sections
- Typical workflows and documentation
- AmtClt command line tool wrappers
- Pester Unit Tests
- Marketing: Make it obvious why Mturk API with typed data is cool
